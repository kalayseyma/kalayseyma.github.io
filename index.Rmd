# **Data Journalist**

I'm a writer who loves data - on markets, business, sports and love.

I find data, scrape it, clean it, build datasets, turn data into visuals, and tell stories around it. From 270-character tweets to 8,000-word white papers. 

You're probably sitting on a lot of data now that you're not using. Data that could help tell your story, awe your customers, and bring your unique perspective to a global audience.

How can I help you explain yourself to the world?
